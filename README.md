# seqvisr
Biological sequence visualization functions in `R`.

Currently consists of a single function--`msavisr`--that can be used to visualize multiple sequence alignments in R using `ggplot2`. More functions (and functionality) to be added in the future.

### Installation
From the `R` commandline, execute `devtools::install_github("vragh/seqvisr")` to install the package. (The `R` package `devtools` must be installed and available for this operation.)

### Usage
See `?seqvisr` and `?msavisr` (from within `R`) to access documentation and examples.
