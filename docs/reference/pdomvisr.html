      <th>inpdat</th>
      <td><p>(character string or name of an object, mandatory) the character string may be the
name of a file or the full path to it (in which case mypath should be set to NULL). The file must
be a table containing the information necessary to plot the domain structure diagram. Alternatively,
inpdat can also be supplied the name of an object in R's environment (e.g., a data.frame containing
the requisite data). This is useful when the input data needs to be pre-processed in R first. The
path/filename option is more suitable when pdomvisr is being called only for plotting. In this case,
data.table's fread() is used to read the data into the function first. Please see the 'Details' section
for information on how the input data must be formatted.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>mypath</th>
      <td><p>(character string, optional) in the event that inpdat is supplied the name of a file, the
path to where this file is located can be supplied through mypath.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>nbreaks</th>
      <td><p>(numeric, optional) controls the number of X-axis ticks in the plotted domain structure
diagram. If the user does not supply a number, this is automatically calculated to produce a tick every
100 residues (based on the length of the longest sequence included in the plot).</p></td>

      <th>cbfcols</th>
      <td><p>(boolean, optional) controls whether colorblind-friendly colors will be used for the
domains. (Set to FALSE by default.)</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>legend</th>
      <td><p>(boolean, optional) controls whether the legend associating the domain colors to the domain
descriptions should be plotted along with the main plot. (Set to TRUE by default.)</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>show_offsets</th>
      <td><p>(boolean, optional) controls whether sequence offsets should be plotted or hidden.
A sequence offset is a whole number (supplied as a part of the input table) indicating how far off from
the actual first residue of the sequence the first residue indicated in the input data is. This is relevant
when plotting partial sequences for instance (e.g., an internal fragment). (Set to TRUE by default.)</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>label_size</th>
      <td><p>(character or numeric, optional) controls whether the domain descriptions are displayed as
labels on the domains. Also controls the size of the text if the labels are displayed. The size can be
controlled by supplying a positive integer &gt; 0. Supplying 0 prevents the labels from being displayed. Passing
"auto" leaves the size estimation to R. If set to "repel", then the labels are drawn offset from the features
and connected to them by straight lines. If set to "repel", the arguments nudge_x and nudge_y (see below) can
be adjusted by the user to vary the positioning of the labels. Note: this argument's values do not affect the
legend. (Set to "auto" by default.)</p></td>

    <tr>
      <th>hfeat</th>
      <td><p>(numeric, optional) controls the height of the tiles corresponding to the DOMAIN portions of the

      <td><p>(character, optional) fill color for the tiles representing the non-domain portions of the

to that particular argument. (Set to "black" by default.)</p></td>

      <th>filloff</th>
      <td><p>(character, optional) fill color for the tiles representing the offset sequence. Any value
accepted by ggplot2's "fill" is accepted here, as this just passes the value on to that particular argument.

    <p>pdomvisr() plots a domain structure diagram given the coordinates of domains in one or more sequences.</p>
<p>The only mandatory input is a table with the following information (in this particular order): sequence name,
sequence length, sequence offset, domain description, domain start coordinate, domain end coordinate. Most column
names are self-explanatory, and should be readily produced by most domain annotation tools (or should be producible
by hand). The only column that will have to be created by the user is the sequence offset column. This is a special
feature that is strictly optional. The objective of this column is to indicate how far away from the actual start
of the sequence the "indicated" start of the sequence is. For example, if a sequence is listed as being 200 residues
long, and has an offset value of 10, this implies that the sequence is actually 210 residues long, but only the last
200 residues "exist". The offset column is useful for visually demonstrating that a sequence is partial. If none of
the sequences are partial and/or in no need of an offset, the values in this column should be set to 0. It is mandatory
that this column exists (with a default value of 0 in all rows) even if it is not in use!!</p>
<p>Each row in the input table should correspond to the coordinates for a particular domain in a particular sequence.
Therefore, if a sequence contains more than one domain, it will have to be represented by as many rows as there are
domains in it. The sequence name, sequence length, and sequence offset columns will (unfortunately) have to be repeated
in all such rows, despite being redundant in this manner.</p>
<p>The input data can be any tabular file that data.table's fread() can parse. Alternatively, the user can also supply
the name of an R object containing the data. The R object in question can be a data.frame, data.table::data.table,
or tibble::tibble. This is useful in a situation where the data has had to have been munged in order to prepare it
for plotting with pdomvisr(). This input (file name, file name + path, or object name) is the only mandatory argument
required by pdomvisr(). The tabular input format was chosen as it is tool and platform agnostic, and most prominent
annotation tools (e.g., Hmmer3 and InterProScan) are capable of producing outputs in this format (or produce outputs
coercible into this format).</p>
<p>pdomvisr() uses ggplot2::ggplot() internally to draw the domain structure diagram. In specific, it uses ggplot2::
geom_tile() to render each position in the sequence as its own tile. pdomvisr() uses an internal function
(tsvtogginp_multi()) to transform the input data into a "long" style data.frame consisting of one row per position
per sequence. Each position is identified as belonging to one of three (ggplot2) layers: offset, base, or feature.
The offset layer, as the name suggests, represents all positions that form the "offset sequence". The base layer
includes all positions that are neither a part of the offset sequence nor a part of a domain in the sequence. The
domain layer includes all residues that belong to a domain. Additional columns exist to indicate labeling (and other
logistics) for the domains. As there is no upper or lower bound on the length of a domain as far as pdomvisr() is
concerned, even single residues (e.g., an active site) can be annotated by adding a row carrying the same value for the
start and end positions for the "domain".</p>
<p>pdomvisr() plots the diagram on the current device (the plot pane in RStudio, for example) and also returns the ggplot2
object itself to the parent environment from which the function was called. The user therefore has complete control over
the output.</p>
    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="note"><a class="anchor" href="#note"></a>Note</h2>

    <p>In some cases it may be necessary to include a sequence that has no annotated domains. Most domain annotation tools would
not include a row for such sequences. But as long as the user adds a row to the input table manually with the sequence
description column set to NA, and the start and end positions of the domain set to 0, a sequence with no annotated domains
will still show up in the plot.</p>
